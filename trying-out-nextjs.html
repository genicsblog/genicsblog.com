xl:max-w-[70%]"> <article class="p-6 md:p-8"> <p>You read the title right! I tried something other than Android this time :P</p> <p>I have always been wanting to learn web development. If you know my background, you probably know I first learned HTML, CSS, and really basic Javascript at first. If not, consider reading <a href="/3-years-of-blogging">this article</a> to know more about my journey.</p> <p>But just learning that wasn’t enough to make better websites. Technically we can make functional websites with them. But <strong>it isn’t intuitive</strong>. Using just HTML and CSS to make a good-looking website is a headache because files become too long to manage. At least that was the case for me :(</p> <p>Sure, you can use tools like Tailwind CSS, but neither was I aware of such tools nor did I knew there are frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, etc. which can make the process of building websites easy.</p> <p>It was obvious that I left web dev back then and that was when I turned to Android. I have been doing Android dev for more than 2 years now. And I recently realized - <strong>staying in a single domain while the tech world progresses will slow down your progress</strong>.</p> <p>I am not saying you should learn everything that comes out each day. But having a gist of other things won’t be harming you. I have tried both things- sticking to a single tech and also trying different things. And I bet you, trying new things teaches more than repeating what you know again and again!</p> <p>For a long time, I wanted to try out web dev again, more because websites work on any device, and just knowing Android was limiting me to the devices I can make apps for.</p> <p>The <a href="https://hashnode.com/bootcamp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hashnode Bootcamp</a>’s Day 5 task was a perfect moment I could try a new thing and write about it. And here I am writing about using Next.js for two really basic things I needed to work on. Here are the projects:</p> <h2 id="birthday-wish-generator">Birthday Wish Generator</h2> <p><strong><a href="https://hbdwish.ml" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">Check it out</a></strong></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/gouravkhunger/nextjs-birthday-wish" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a></p> <p>One of my friend’s birthdays is near and I wanted to do something special for them. And looking at the Next.js, I quickly thought to make a simple page with some confetti popping in the background, and their name on the front.</p> <p>I quickly made the project with:</p> <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npx create-next-app nextjs-birthday-wish
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But this thought struck my mind: Since I am gonna deploy it to Vercel anyway, I can make a home page where anyone can enter the name of the person they want to send a wish, and then copy the generated link to be sent.</p> <p>Also, I could make it open source <s>just to increase the number of reports on my profile so that I can flex on the count</s>.</p> <p>I quickly created two pages, along with their CSS modules. Here are the screenshots:</p> <h3 id="home-page">Home Page</h3> <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632674975999/NHbFfU1vZ.jpeg" alt="one.jpeg" loading="lazy"></p> <h3 id="birthday-wish">Birthday Wish</h3> <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632675120489/1uZ_YLvsn.jpeg" alt="two.jpeg" loading="lazy"></p> <p>I completed the project in 3 hours, took so long because I had to test 7 different confetti libraries that work with Next.js 😂. Finally used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/confetti-js" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confetti-js</a>.</p> <p>I also spent some time on CSS and the routing stuff- because I don’t know CSS that well, but I am improving day by day. The CSS design of this blog is done by me!</p> <p>But I think I did a pretty decent job. And it was fun trying next js for the first time, it’s a great framework on top of React, so if you are learning Next.js you are learning concepts of React too. So it is a win-win case.</p> <h2 id="striked-text-generator"><s>Striked Text Generator</s></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://strikeit.ml/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">Check it out</a></strong></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/gouravkhunger/nextjs-strikeit" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a></p> <p>Here are the images:</p> <h3 id="home-page-1">Home Page</h3> <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632674734678/ik7IJW6Yt.jpeg" alt="one.jpeg" loading="lazy"></p> <h3 id="preview-of-striked-text">Preview of striked text</h3> <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632674743501/Wvr_3Y_om.jpeg" alt="two.jpeg" loading="lazy"></p> <p>I needed this generator because I use Google Calendar to stay focused and plan the work I have for a day.</p> <p>I don’t clutter my day with huge time boxes because that doesn’t work for me and I need the flexibility to carry out my tasks.</p> <p>What I do is: I copy a template of three events for each day the day before it, and put the things I need to carry out in their respective category.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632672045301/bk9x2KLPn.png" alt="image.png" loading="lazy"></p> <p>This works well for me. But actually, the text in google calendar events cannot be striked through once it is completed- as you can do for tasks rather than events.</p> <p>I could have used many of the text formatting tools available online to cut my text and strike to check them off. But I generally forget random website names and the same would be the case with many 😂. Also, most free tools have ads and trackers, which isn’t convenient.</p> <p>So, why not try to build this thing with Next.js? <s>The thought of increasing repo count on GitHub profile still came 😜</s>.</p> <p>I again quickly made a new Next.js project, deleted the unnecessary blurb that comes by default then <s>copied from the last project</s> added the text box.</p> <p>This time I faced a new difficulty- to display the striked text preview in a paragraph below the input box. I could set an event listener when the input box’s text changed, but didn’t know what to do to get a reference of the paragraph below it, as we can’t do the traditional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">document.getElementById()</code> in Next.js apps.</p> <p>With some research, I learned we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">useRef</code> to maintain a ref of elements, and it worked! I learned how <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53836006/9819031" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this snippet</a> gives you striked version of the text and then implemented it when input occurs.</p> <p>I learned how easy it is to copy something to the device clipboard using Next.js. This piece of snippet does the work:</p> <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">navigator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">clipboard</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">writeText</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">This will be copied!</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>It took me ~4 hours for this project because I wanted to make it responsive and I was struggling with the input box width for different screens, at the end made it work well with some hit and trial 😆</p> <h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1> <p>I hope you liked the article, consider commenting to let me know what you think!</p> <p>It was my first experience with Next.js and I must admit it was really good. Though I got many errors and go to learn a lot in the meantime, it was worth it!</p> <p>Do check out the projects on GitHub and star them. And since you are going to star them, why not follow me there too? 😆</p> <p>I post resourceful content on this blog, consider subscribing to the newsletter by filling the form at the top of the article to get notified of the new content that I keep posting.
