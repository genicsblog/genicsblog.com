A few weeks ago, I came across Edidiong Asikpo's [article](https://edidiongasikpo.com/the-technical-writers-guide-to-contributing-to-open-source-projects)  about contributing to open-source projects. 
The article piqued my interest and I set out to learn how to contribute to open-source projects without possibly writing any code.

In this article, I will share with you what I discovered and also mention some non-code ways you can contribute, open-source projects you can contribute to, and helpful resources.

# What are Open Source Projects?

Open Source is a term used to describe software whose original source code is freely available, can be redistributed, and also modified.
Open Source embodies a spirit of collaboration, transparency, and community-oriented contributions, among other things.

# How can technical writers and non-code individuals contribute to open source projects?

![How can technical writer, designer and non coders contribute to open source](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634906360847/aibto3F98.png)

Like many people, I used to think it was impossible to contribute to open source projects without having any coding skills but reading various articles written by [Kesi Parker](https://twitter.com/ParkerKesi) and [Edidiong Asikpo](https://twitter.com/Didicodes) helped debunk this notion.

In this section, I will mention some non-code ways you can contribute to open source projects as a non-coder.

1. **Do you like to write?**
You can help to improve or write the project documentation. You can also create translated documentation for the project.

2. **How about design?** 
As a designer, you can contribute to open source projects by restructuring the project’s usability. You can also create a logo and style guide. 

3. **Have a knack for organizing perhaps?**
You can suggest issues labels and close open issues to keep the repository clean. 

4. **Do you enjoy assisting others?**
Moderate discussion boards and respond to questions on forums like Microsoft Tech Community,  Reddit, and Stack Overflow.

5. **Teaching?**
Write how-to and educational tutorials, as well as supporting materials. You can also create YouTube videos about the software.

6. **Advocating?**
Organize project-related workshops or meetups. You could motivate others by telling them about your personal experiences.

7. **Join testing and insider programs:** Finding and reporting bugs, and providing honest feedback on a project can increase its success rate and provide a better user experience.

So no, you don't have to code to contribute. While this is by no means an exhaustive list, it should be enough to get you started.

# Benefits of contributing to open-source projects

![Benefits of contributing to open source projects](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634906376850/1b1HfYy7-.png)

While there are usually no direct monetary benefits to contributing, there are other ways you as a contributor can benefit:

- Upskilling and the opportunity to improve on existing skills.
- Creating a portfolio and personal achievement.
- Meeting like-minded people and networking.
- Understanding the application development and maintenance cycles.
- Community recognition.
- Self-recognition as an open-source contributor.
- Recommendation, referral, and increased job opportunities. Here is a [testimony](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cracking-google-season-of-docs-2020/)
- Mentorship and knowledge sharing.
- Community building.
- **Compensation:** There are rarely any direct monetary incentives, however, programs such as [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs), [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), [Hyperledger Mentorship Program](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN), [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), and the [Open Collective bounty program](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/contributing/development/bounties) pay you to contribute.
