Many different philosophies or paradigms have been used to design different programming languages. Since they are not mutually exclusive. programming languages often embody several core ideas. Depending on the programmer's preferred approach, they can also be used in different ways. Python, for example, can be used for both object-oriented and procedural programming. The best approach or the best programming language to use often depends on the programmer's preference and goals. Below are some of the ways programming languages can be defined and classified.

## 1️⃣ Imperative Programming

These languages require a list of instructions for the computer to carry out. The programmer has first to work out how the task can be completed, and then provide step-by-step instructions to the computer. Imperative languages are common and include Python, C, C++, and Java.

**Input in Python**
```py
user = input("What's your name?")
print("Hello", user)
```

**Output in Python**
```
What's your name? Sean
Hello Sean
```

## 2️⃣ Declarative Programming

In declarative programming, programmers tell the computer what result they want, without needing to say how it will be achieved. In the Wolfram language, for example, a word cloud based on the countries with highest populations can be created using a single line. Other declarative languages include SQL which is used for databases.

## 3️⃣ Event-driven programming

The event-driven programming concept is one where the program listens for certain things to happen, and then starts the appropriate program sequence when they do. For example, a program might react to user actions, sensor input, or messages from other computer systems. Javascript and Scratch, among others, can be used to write event-driven programs.

**Example**

```
<input type="button" value="Click me!"
onClick="showMessage();">
```

## 4️⃣ Procedural Programming

This type of programming is based on functions, which contain reusable chunks. Functions can start other functions at any time, and can even start themselves again. They make programs easier to develop, test, and manage. Many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python support procedural programming.

## 5️⃣ Object-oriented programming

In object-oriented programming, the idea is that data and its instructions are stored together in "objects". Objects can interact with each other to achieve the program's objectives. The aim is to make code more modular, so it is easier to manage and is more reusable. Many popular programming languages, such as C++, Java, Javascript, and Python support object-oriented programming.

## 6️⃣ Visual Programming languages

These languages make it easier to develop software using drag-and-drop interfaces, so a programmer can create software more quickly and with fewer errors. Visual basic, for example, includes tools to design user interfaces visually. Scratch, is another highly visual language, often used to learn to program.

## Conclusion

Sometimes, programmers' choice of language may be dictated by the hardware they are using, the team they are programming with, or the kind of application they want to create. From the variety of languages we discussed today, I hope you can make a better choice in your language.
