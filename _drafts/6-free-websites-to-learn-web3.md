Hi everyone, I found some of the great websites to learn web3.0, which I found when I was searching for Web3 knowledge.

Let's have some basic understanding of what Web3 is before we dive into the awesome list. Based on [Eshita's article](https://eshita.mirror.xyz/H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI) she describes it in a very simple way.

- Web1 *(read)* ðŸ˜¬
- Web2 *(read and write)* ðŸ˜¨
- Web3 *(read, write, and own)* ðŸ˜±

We are currently in the middle of this transition from Web2 to Web3. For me, Web3 is not just hype. Web3 is here a long time ago waiting for us to adapt, transition, and accept the future of the internet. You should start learning Web3 right now while it is early we have nothing to lose if you know both Web2 and Web3 which is better than nothing!

### 1.  [BuildSpace](https://buildspace.so)

Let's start this awesome list with BuildSpace! This is indeed a top place to learn and build real-world Web3 projects by doing. Why on top? BuildSpace offers different projects for you to start hacking.

You know what! you'll earn free exclusive and unique NFT when you're able to complete a project tutorial. On top of that, you'll get a special Discord role in their official Discord community to represent what you've learned and where you enroll.

For every project you completed you'll earn enough experience that leads you to get full-time work remotely on popular Web3 companies with the help of BuildSpace. 

### 2.  [Odyssey DAO](https://odysseydao.com)

Another personal favorite! this is a good alternative to BuildSpace the only difference is that this is a learning DAO community. **DAO means a decentralized autonomous organization**, Odyssey has a pretty good definition of this.

[A DAO is a community thatâ€™s owned and managed by its members](https://www.odysseydao.com/articles/what-is-dao).

Here's a good thing about Odyssey, they made it possible to provide 100% free Web3 education with the help of the community around it by offering NFTs and tokens. For me, this is a great use of NFTs and tokens because you're getting NFTs and tokens for a cause, not just you want to have an NFT and tokens. 


### 3. [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io)

Honestly, unlike BuildSpace and Odyssey, **this one is a pretty good place to learn Web3 in a fun and interactive way for free.**  And you know what It is opensource!**

**It is recommended and helpful to have at least a technical background in programming, but that's not necessary or required for you to start learning blockchain development**. Just go with the flow and take their courses and learn as much as possible. 

Currently, they offer 4 paths â€” **Solidity, Advance Solidity, Chainlink, and Beyond Ethereum.** Which is enough for you to be considered as a blockchain developer. With the help of these paths, you will be able to develop your smart contracts, launch NFTs, and build NFT games. 

### 4. [CryptoDevHub](cryptodevhub.io)

![cryptodevhub.io](https://decentralizedcreator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CryptoDevHub.png)

If you like the wiki-style of learning about Web3 then this is the right place for you. **CryptoDevHub is a wiki-type website where you can find tons of information about Web3.** It also offers some guides for you to get started with Web3 development. There is a community around it where Web3 learners, developers hang out by helping each other to build Web3 apps. 

### 5. [NFT School](nftschool.dev)

![nftschool.dev](https://nftschool.dev/images/social-card.png)

NFT is one of the features of Web3 so why not add it to the list. **I can define NFT School as the Web3 version of W3 School but for NFTs.** 

Wait, what is NFT? Well, NFT stands for [Non-Fungible Tokens](https://nftschool.dev/concepts/non-fungible-tokens/#a-bit-of-history). To keep it simple, NFTs are just like a ticket to a concert where you can buy it and keep it forever and you might sell it to collectors in the future since it has value, the same idea with paintings and artworks. Buy the digital copy of it and keep it for yourself or sell it to collectors. 

### 6. [UseWeb3](useweb3.xyz)

![useweb3.xyz](https://www.useweb3.xyz/images/social.png)

A great opensource community-contributed resource for Web3 enthusiasts like you. Better to check this out and bookmark it to your favorite browser because you're gonna use it on your entire Web3 journey. 

It is like a simple website that has a list of very useful information related to Web3 space. 

No more to say, very useful Web3 resource!

###  Bonus Content

Imagine if you could build Web3 applications without coding. 

That's actually possible with the help of the [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com)! 

It enables no-code developers to participate in Web3 space without knowing Solidity or Rust to interact with smart contracts. Aside from being a no-code platform, you can actually use the programming language you already know such as JavaScript, Python, and much more... just to build some Web3 cool stuff! 

Check out [this guide](https://thirdweb.com/portal/guides/release-an-nft-drop-with-no-code) to get started! 

In addition, **Hashnode is currently hosting a [Web3 hackathon event](https://townhall.hashnode.com/thirdweb-hackathon) together with [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com) at the time of this writing**. So it is better to check that out and win some cool prizes.

**If you have any Web3 resources that we should know, kindly comment below!** 

Thanks for reading, good luck with your Web3 journey! ðŸ’–
