This draft is available at [https://genicsblog.com/draft/test](/draft/test).

This is a test page to demonstrate how drafts work at [Genics Blog](https://genicsblog.com). Draft articles do not show up at the main website and neither is their link shown publicly(unless someone digs into the drafts folder at github ðŸ‘€). Drafts at Genics Blog are set to not be indexed by search engines.

To make a draft, all you need to do is to fork the repository. Inside the `_drafts` folder, you can copy this `test.md` file and change it's name and content to start writing your draft. Once you create a pull request for the `_drafts` folder, it is automatically merged if you just changed a draft file and not anything else.

Drafts are available at `https://genicsblog.com/draft/<name-of-draft-file-slugified>`. They are publicly links so please share them only if you are sure.
