Beginning November 28, 2022, Heroku, one of the most popular go to choice used by developers to host their apps, announced that it would be shutting down its free tier.

The Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider's free tier used to provide a generous 550 hours of dyno uptime which could be easily extended to 1000 hours with a verified credit card.

Even though these dynos shut down after 30 minutes, it could be resolved by various methods to [keep Heroku apps awake](/gouravkhunger/8-ways-to-keep-your-heroku-app-awake), thus becoming the easiest way to host software project for free.

The free tier shutdown news left many developers in search for alternative hosting platforms that could provide similar API and website hosting services free of cost. As a result, I have compiled a list of the top 9 free Heroku alternatives to use in 2023.

While there are many hosting platforms available in the market, these carefully selected services provide the best options for developers to host their Frontend/Backend applications, APIs, Servers, etc.

These alternatives offer features similar to Heroku, such as support for multiple programming languages, easy deployment, and scalability. So whether you are a seasoned developer or just getting started, keep reading to discover the top free Heroku alternative hosting platforms:
