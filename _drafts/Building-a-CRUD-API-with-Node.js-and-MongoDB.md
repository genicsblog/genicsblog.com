Howdy everyone, in this article we are going to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API with  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). This API will be able to add, get, edit and delete todos!

## Setting up our node app

Create a new folder and give it a name-

```
mkdir crud-API
```

Navigate into the project-

```
cd crud-API
```

Initialize node-

```
npm init -y
```

Installing the packages needed-

```
 npm install mongoose express dotenv cors
```

Installing nodemon as dev dependency-

```
npm install -D nodemon
```

## Creating our server

Create a new file `index.js` and add the following-

```
const express = require("express");

const PORT = 8000;

const app = express();

app.listen(PORT, async () => {
  console.log(`server up on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Inside package.json and inside of `scripts` add this new script-

```
"start": "nodemon index.js"
```

If you now run `npm run start` it will show **server up on port 8000** in the console

## Creating the router and routes

Create a new file `router.js` and add the following-

```
const router = require("express").Router();

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Let's build a CRUD API!");
});

module.exports = router;
```

This will create a new get create route on the home page. So let's use the router in our app now. Go back to `index.js` and add a middleware like this-

```
app.use(router);
```

We also need to import router-

```
const router = require("./router");
```

If you now go to  [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) we can see "Let's build a CRUD API!" 🥳

## Setting up MongoDB

Go to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and sign up/login. After you sign in click on create a new project and give your project a name!

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641481563753/QrhtaOhMY.png)

You can also add a member if you want but I am not going to do that right now.

After the project has been created, click on *Build a database*. You will be able to see 3 plans to choose from. We are good to go with the free one for now. It will prompt you to select a location for your database, I would recommend you to go with the closes one :)

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641481727736/lNwDldKp-.png)

Create a new user with a username and password, you are going to need this to connect MongoDB to your node.js app so don't forget it so fast :P. Now, select database in the sidebar. It will probably show you that the cluster is being created so wait for some time.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641481882117/HGe6n3j1a.png)

After the database is created click on **Connect**. You can allow access from everywhere for now. 

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641481984705/7NRmEugH-.png)

Finally, click on choose a connection method then connect your application. Copy the URL that you get as we are going to need it now.


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641482056780/HJxQtKqHQ.png)


Let's head back to our code now.

## Connecting MongoDB to Node.js

Inside of our app create a new file `.env` and create a new variable `MONGODB_URL` like this-

```
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://avneesh0612:password>@cluster0.wz3aq.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority```

You need to replace the URL with the one you got from MongoDB and also change the password to your actual password.

Go to `index.js` and add in the following for connecting our app to MongoDB-

```
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.MONGODB_URL, {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

Import mongoose-

```
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
```

You also need to restart the server as we have changed the env variables. So, cut the server and restart the dev server with `npm start`

This is going to give us an error as we haven't configured our env variables yet, so you need to add just these two lines-

```
const dotenv = require("dotenv");

dotenv.config();
```

It finally shows us that our app is connected to MongoDB!

## Creating the Model for our Todo

We are going to create a new folder `Model` to keep things organized. So, create a new folder `Model` and a file `Todo.js` inside of it. Our model is going to have only 4 things- `title`, `description`, `completed`, and `createdAt`. So add the following in `Todo.js`-

```
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const TodoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
  },
  completed: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false,
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("Todo", TodoSchema);
```

 If you want to have more/less data then feel free to edit this.


## Creating CRUD functionality

Create a new folder `controllers` and `Todo.js` inside of it. I am going to create a dummy function for now-

```
const getTodos = (req, res) => {
  res.send("I am the get todos route");
};

module.exports = {
  getTodos,
};
```

Now, go to `router.js` and create a new get route like this-

```
router.get("/todos", getTodos);
```

You also need to import `getTodos`-

```
const { getTodos } = require("./controllers/Todo");
```

If you now go to  [http://localhost:8000/todos](http://localhost:8000/todos) then it will show you "I am the get todos route"

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641483166717/V3avffkKx.png)

First, let's build the create functionality then we will do the read functionality!

### Building Create functionality

Create a new POST todos route in `router.js`-

```
router.post("/todos", createTodo);
```

Import createTodo from the controller-

```
const { getTodos, createTodo } = require("./controllers/Todo");
```

Now create a new function in `controllers/Todo.js`-

```
const createTodo = (req, res) => {
  const todo = new Todo({
    title: req.body.title,
    description: req.body.description,
    completed: req.body.completed,
  });

  todo.save((err, todo) => {
    if (err) {
      res.send(err);
    }
    res.json(todo);
  });
};
```
This is going to take the `title`, `description`, and `completed` from the body and create a new Todo from the model that we created. Also, it will save it to to the database with the `.save` function. We also need to import `Todo` like this-

```
const Todo = require("../model/Todo");
```

We also need to export createTodo-

```
module.exports = {
  getTodos,
  createTodo,
};
```

I am going to use  [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the API. You can use any client :). So open postman and create a new post request to  [http://localhost:8000/todos](http://localhost:8000/todos) with this in the body-

```
{
    "title": "Title 1",
    "description": "Description 1",
    "completed": false
}
```

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641537330553/BScnjJoIT.png)

Let's hit send 🥁, and we get an error.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641537369607/4CGUbdzCe.png)

We get this error because we haven't used some middleware. So inside of `index.js` just above `app.use(router)` and below mongoose.connect add the following middlewares-

```
app.use(cors());

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

We also need to import cors-

```
const cors = require("cors");
```

If we re-run the request on Postman, it works!

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641537549997/iTXN_7pGn.png)


### Building Read functionality

We are going to need to change the `getTodos` function that we created. So, replace the function with this-

```
const getTodos = (req, res) => {
  Todo.find((err, todos) => {
    if (err) {
      res.send(err);
    }
    res.json(todos);
  });
};
```

This is going to show all the todos in the collection of "Todos", now if we make a GET request to  [http://localhost:8000/todos](http://localhost:8000/todos) then it will show us all the todos! Currently, we have only one.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641538593222/J52-Pqe-S.png)

We can also test this by adding another todo and it will then show us both the todos.


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641538653691/LMuxHDP8z.png)

### Edit functionality

Create a new PUT route in `router.js`-

```
router.put("/todos/:todoID", updateTodo);
```

Import it from `controllers/Todo.js`-

```
const { getTodos, createTodo, updateTodo } = require("./controllers/Todo");
```

Inside `controllers/Todo.js` let's build our `updateTodo` function-

```
const updateTodo = (req, res) => {
  Todo.findOneAndUpdate(
    { _id: req.params.todoID },
    {
      $set: {
        title: req.body.title,
        description: req.body.description,
        completed: req.body.completed,
      },
    },
    { new: true },
    (err, Todo) => {
      if (err) {
        res.send(err);
      } else res.json(Todo);
    }
  );
};
```

This will take a new `title`, `description`, and `completed` from the request body and update it according to the id in the URL. So, in postman create a new PUT request to  [http://localhost:8000/todos/todo_id](http://localhost:8000/todos/todo_id). You also need to provide data in the body-

```
{
    "title": "Title 3",
    "description": "Description 3",
    "completed": false
}
```
It works! 🎉

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641539951484/KDMf5aZSv.png)

If you make a new GET request, you will see the updated todos.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641540003110/QPfvHNrPF.png)


### Delete functionality

Create another route in `router.js`-

```
router.delete("/todos/:todoID", deleteTodo);
```

You also need to import as always-

```
const {
  getTodos,
  createTodo,
  updateTodo,
  deleteTodo,
} = require("./controllers/Todo");
```

Finally, create a new function in `Todo.js`-

```
const deleteTodo = (req, res) => {
  Todo.deleteOne({ _id: req.params.todoID })
    .then(() => res.json({ message: "Todo Deleted" }))
    .catch((err) => res.send(err));
};
```

This will take the todoID from the URL and delete it. Export the function-

```
module.exports = {
  getTodos,
  createTodo,
  updateTodo,
  deleteTodo,
};
```

Let's put it to the test now. It works now!


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641540501970/J51YyZxZ2l.png)


We now have a fully working CRUD API! Let's deploy it to Heroku now.


## Deploying to Heroku

### Creating a GitHub repo

Initialize git-

```
git init
```

Create a new file `.gitignore` and add the node modules in it-

```
/node_modules
```

Commit the code-

```
git add .

git commit -m "your commit message"
```

Go on GitHub and create a  [New Repo](https://github.com/new). You can give it any name you like!

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641540984748/ODEVW_8Oh.png)

Copy the commands in "push an existing repository from the command line" and paste it into your terminal.

If you now refresh the page, you will be able to see your code!

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641541147661/83n1nZ7ZS.png)

Now, go to [heroku](https://heroku.com/), sign in/sign up. Then, create a new app


Give your app a name and hit "Create app"

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641541408361/svlAnPnpX.png)

Connect GitHub and select your repository.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641541552495/D52ZnJBfg.png)

You can enable automatic deploys and also click on deploy branch.


We also need to add the env variables, so go to the settings tab, scroll down to Config Vars and paste in the variable.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641541717089/Ffo01DZdp.png)

You are going to see an error in your app, so head back to the code! Inside package.json change the start script to-

```
node index.js
```

The script should look like this-

```
"start": "node index.js"
```

We also need to change the port, so inside `index.js` change port to this-

```
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;
```

Now, you can push the code again!

```
git add .

git commit -m "fix: deploy errors"

git push
```

If you enabled automatic deploys then it will deploy automatically, else manually deploy the branch. Now our API successfully works! This is the API if you want to try it out: [https://crud-api-demo.herokuapp.com/](https://crud-api-demo.herokuapp.com/).
