Genics Blog is an [open source platform](https://github.com/genicsblog) for developers to share technical knowledge. It is a publication where we post high quality resources that developers find useful. Each article on the platform goes through a series of quality checks before being published and that's what sets us apart.

We have an active community of developers and content writes on our [Discord server](https://discord.genicsblog.com) and [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/genicsblog). Being open source, the codebase on GitHub is actively maintained by community contributions.

## The team

We are a team of high school developers and bloggers who are building a community of technical writers. As individual writers, we understood that the content that we wrote didn't get enough reach, and the platforms we publish to seem like a black whole of content. That's where Genics started.

## How can you benefit?

Not only content publishing, we help authors in our community improve rankings of their own blogs and sites by helping them with [SEO](/category/seo/). SEO can be hard, but we help technical content writers to get started.

Since back-linking is a major factor that determines google ranking of a website, and it can get hard to get backlinks from a trusted source, here at genics we make it really easy for authors to get their own content higher reach. All the original articles are eligible to get 2 quality backlinks, that increases Domain Authority of the linked sites.
