Today we will see a few ways to not clean code in React, let’s jump right into it!</p> <p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/iMBEgyXkFBtdCFS93i/200.gif" alt="Jump right into it"/></p> <h2 id="10-ways-to-not-write-clean-code">10 ways to not write clean code</h2> <h3 id="not-using-a-linter">Not using a linter</h3> <p>Who needs a linter to keep good code styles, and keep the code clean when you can define the rules as you go. 🚨</p> <h3 id="add-everything-in-one-file">Add everything in one file</h3> <p>Just put everything in one file, so you don’t need to create many different files and components and can have 1000s of lines in one file. The compilation build time will also be very small if you use just a single file! 🙈</p> <h3 id="write-duplicate-code">Write duplicate code</h3> <p>Why reuse variables, and components when you can copy-paste the same code over and over again and if you need to change one small thing then spend a ton of time adjusting it everywhere. So productivity++ 😌</p> <h3 id="have-unused-importsvariables-everywhere">Have unused imports/variables everywhere</h3> <p>Why care to delete the unused variables and import them when they can stay where they are and increase your app bundle size. 📈</p> <h3 id="prop-drilling">Prop drilling</h3> <p>Just keep passing props 10 components deep because who wants to use a tool to manage state properly 🥱.</p> <h3 id="not-destructure-objects">Not destructure objects</h3> <p>Who cares about destructuring objects, keep doing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{object.a}</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{object.b}</code> everywhere. 🧐</p> <h3 id="not-using-typescript">Not using typescript</h3> <p>Who needs to use typescript when you can pass a number for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> somewhere and string for the same variable somewhere 🤷‍♂️</p> <h3 id="not-using-enums">Not using enums</h3> <p>Who doesn’t love typos!? Why use enums when you can make a typo and mess up your entire code base and pull your hair for 2 days to find the error after breaking production 🤡</p> <h3 id="use-random-names-for-functions-variables-components">Use random names for functions, variables, components</h3> <p>Why waste time thinking about a great function/variable/component name, use a random name and save time. 🕰</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>I hope you were able to understand how not to write clean code, now it is up to you to choose if you wanna write good code or bad code!

I know this is super late in the month, but I wanted to share some updates on the blog from the past months.</p> <p>Before diving into the latest news at Genics, I would like to introduce myself. I am <a href="/author/gouravkhunger/">Gourav Khunger</a>, the founder of <a href="/">Genics Blog</a>. I am a teenager from India who is passionate about software development and <a href="/tag/open-source/">open source</a>.</p> <p>In the <a href="/genics-log-1">last article</a> in this series, we talked about how we went open source and how we managed to grow from 200 visitors/month to 500+ visitors/month, along with sponsorship from <a href="https://beyondwords.io/?utm_source=genicsblog.com&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=advertisement">BeyondWords</a>.</p> <p>This log is more inclined towards the core theme infrastructure and how we managed to grow our community to 600+ readers now.</p> <p>Let’s get started!</p> <h2 id="staging-envs-with-vercel">Staging ENVs with Vercel</h2> <p>This was a crucial step in forming a better infrastructure for building <a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/theme-files">the theme</a> and its plugins.</p> <h3 id="previous-setup">Previous setup</h3> <p>From the beginning itself, I planned to create a separate repository for the theme just because it would allow us to use a separate GitHub Pages for <a href="https://staging.genicsblog.com">staging.genicsblog.com</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/theme-files/blob/aa7944b1943dbb7206b013dcc1d8102f8c48875e/.github/workflows/setup-staging.yml">This</a> was the GitHub Actions file that deployed the theme to staging url. We made sure to block indexing using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">robots.txt</code> file’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Disallow: /</code> directive.</p> <p>But here comes the tricky part - the staging was not relevant until we were able to deploy PRs to preview them. Staging environment for approved and merged PRs didn’t matter as much as environment for previewing the pending PRs.</p> <p>A huge problem was that we couldn’t use repository secret variables in GitHub Actions if it ran using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull_request</code> event but those variables are needed to deploy to gh-pages.</p> <p>For that, we had to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull_request_target</code> event trigger which allows PR actions to use the repository secrets to access the staging environment.</p> <p>But the catch here is, this comes with <strong>security vulnerabilities</strong> as the PRs are run in the context of the repository base and not the PR base.</p> <p>This could mean that user can manipulate the workflow file to misuse the repository secrets!</p> <h3 id="vulnerability-in-main-repository">Vulnerability in main repository</h3> <p>The above mentioned issue was actually present in the main repository. I had setup a workflow for PRs using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull_request_target</code> because I wanted to automerge “correct” changes to drafts by authors.</p> <p>YES, this was a big mistake but fortunately, no one exploited this vulnerability using which one could clean up the whole repository in minutes (making a delete commit and managing to automerge it using repo secrets).</p> <p>I did have security measures in place:</p> <p>An <a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/genicsblog.com/blob/8f8d936e72d886af28ea232d6e90eaa1442c6518/.github/workflows/validate-drafts.yml#L57-L64">automerge</a> happened <a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/genicsblog.com/blob/8f8d936e72d886af28ea232d6e90eaa1442c6518/.github/workflows/validate-drafts.yml#L54">only if</a> the PR changes article files that are owned by the specific author. The <a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/theme-files/blob/aa7944b1943dbb7206b013dcc1d8102f8c48875e/_scripts/validate-drafts.py">python script</a> referenced takes in the list of files changed in the PR and goes through them to verify if the PR author is the actual author of the article files.</p> <p>Now, you could argue that a person could change the script in the PR and this check would easily be bypassed. That is the reason that the workflow uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget</code> to download the script from the main branch and then run it. It <a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/genicsblog.com/blob/8f8d936e72d886af28ea232d6e90eaa1442c6518/.github/workflows/validate-drafts.yml#L47-L48">deletes the scripts</a> in the PR and downloads the correct one before running.</p> <p>But again, I was still skeptical of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pull_request_target</code> event trigger. The docs don’t clearly mention it, but I am not sure - If the action runs in context of the PR base, then is it possible that the author change the action script and bypasses the script download and other verification checks?</p> <p>This is the reason we now moved to Vercel to off-load all these security issues and still be able to deploy staging ENVs!</p> <h3 id="sponsorship-from-vercel">Sponsorship from Vercel</h3> <p><a href="https://vercel.com/?utm_source=genicsblog&amp;utm_campaign=oss" rel="dofollow">Vercel</a> was generous enough to sponsor our <a href="http://github.com/genicsblog/genicsblog.com">GitHub organization</a> to be able to deploy organization repositories for free!</p> <blockquote> <p>Vercel is a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.</p> </blockquote> <p>This sponsorship now enables us to remove our vulnerable GitHub actions and migrate to Vercel deployments. It was as easy as setting up the installation and build scripts. Vercel automatically deploys all PRs to staging environments!</p> <p>Now we can easily preview pull requests and test them visually before moving them to production!</p> <h2 id="theme-updates">Theme updates</h2> <p>We have worked on massive improvements to the theme and its plugins!</p> <h3 id="paginating-author-pages-7">Paginating author pages (<a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/theme-files/issues/7">#7</a>)</h3> <p>This was by far the biggest need for the theme. Author pages <a href="/author/gouravkhunger/">like this</a> could get super big without pagination and that affects load times a lot.</p> <p>This was a big problem for the Jekyll community as well - there was no plugin to handle multiple authors with ease.</p> <p>This lead me to spend time messing with <a href="https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2">jekyll-paginate-v2</a> and understanding how its pagination works. With some days of effort, I came up with <a href="https://github.com/gouravkhunger/jekyll-auto-authors">jekyll-auto-authors</a> which completely simplifies the process of paginating author pages!</p> <p>Here’s an <a href="https://genicsblog.com/gouravkhunger/adding-multiple-authors-to-a-jekyll-blog-got-easier#2-using-my-plugin-jekyll-auto-authors">in-depth tutorial</a> on using the plugin to paginate author pages.</p> <h3 id="shortcut-commands-10">Shortcut commands (<a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/theme-files/issues/10">#10</a>)</h3> <p>There are new shortcut commands you can use to perform these actions on the site:</p> <ul> <li>Opening up search bar: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">K</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">K</code>.

If so, then here is a quick tutorial on how to use object keys in JavaScript. Do not worry if you don’t know anything about objects yet, this blog covers that as well!</p> <h2 id="what-are-javascript-objects">What are Javascript Objects?</h2> <p>Objects are one of the eight data types in javascript. They are used to store various kinds of complex data in a key-value collection pair.</p> <p>Here’s a simple example on how to create an empty object in JavaScript:</p> <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Object</span><span class="p">();</span>

Each pair is called a “property” of the object.</p> <p>A property is defined using the notation <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">key: value</code>. Here, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> can be any data type or even a javascript function (more on this later).</p> <p>Here’s a visual representation of an object:</p> <p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/954717163808251924/976340109353975828/unknown.png" alt="image"/></p> <p>An Object is created using curly (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{}</code>) brackets and its properties and values are separated by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code> inside.</p> <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

Let’s get started!</p> <h2 id="what-is-authentication">What is Authentication?</h2> <p>Authentication or auth for short is the process where a server recognizes <strong>the identity of a user</strong>. Authorization is then done, to allocate a role to the authenticated user and allocate the required services to that particular user.</p> <p>There are 2 ways you can implement auth:</p> <ul> <li>Sessions</li> <li>JSON Web Tokens</li> </ul> <p>Let’s take a deep dive into sessions!</p> <h2 id="sessions">Sessions</h2> <p>Server-side sessions were the traditional way to implement auth. The flow of a session can be illustrated like this:</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652199081833/Xut5oskzV.png" alt="image.png"/></p> <p>The process begins with the client:</p> <ul> <li>Receiving an e-mail and a password</li> <li>Then, hashing the password</li> <li>And sending the e-mail and the hashed password to the server</li> </ul> <p>Hashing is the process of <strong>scrambling</strong> a value using a key that is sent to an algorithm. <strong>Hashed values can’t be decrypted!</strong> <a href="https://argon2.online">Argon2</a> is an extremely secure hashing algorithm that can be used to hash passwords.</p> <p>While validating the credentials, the server hashes the given password, and the hash stored in the database (during register) and compares both of them. If the hashes match, the server then sends a request to the <strong>session store</strong> for the session ID.</p> <p>A session store is a medium where data related to the logged-in user is stored. It could be in memory or a database. <a href="https://redis.com">Redis</a> is commonly used as a session store because of its speed.</p> <p>The session data contains anything linked to the user who is logged in. It could be the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userId</code> or any field that is unique to the user.</p> <p>This session ID is then sent back to the server, which in turn, sends the ID of the session to the client in the form of a <strong>cookie</strong>. Data on the user can then be accessed using this session ID which the store can query.</p> <p>To log the user out, you can destroy the cookie and delete the key-value pair associated with the session ID in the store.</p> <p>Now let’s take a look at JSON Web Tokens.</p> <h2 id="json-web-tokens-jwts">JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)</h2> <p>JWTs take a completely different approach to solving the problem. Authentication is done on the <strong>client-side</strong> here, rather than in the <strong>server</strong> like in sessions. The process can be illustrated in this way:</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652256338392/ET6Zrh480.png" alt="image.png"/></p> <p>It begins the same way as in sessions, but instead of asking the session store for a session ID, the server issues a <strong>JWT access token</strong> with a JWT Secret.</p> <p>This token is relayed back to the client and should ideally be stored in a cookie. The JWT is not <strong>private</strong> and it should <strong>NOT</strong> contain private information like the hashed password. A token should just contain the user ID or other types of unique, non-jeopardizing data.</p> <p>The JWT can then be used as an <strong>Authorization Header’s Bearer Token</strong> that can be used to run queries that require auth. This JWT can be validated in the server during requests. Since the secret remains private a JWT cannot be forged. To log a user out, the cookie can be destroyed.</p> <p>To keep the app secure, JWT tokens should be short-lived. Another token called a <strong>refresh token</strong> should be signed on login, which can renew the access token when it expires. When a client sends a request with an expired access token, the server would use the given refresh token and use it to generate a new access token. This way, if an attacker gets hold of an access token, the validity of that token is very short.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note: Do NOT store JWTs in localStorage!</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Storing JWTs in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localStorage</code> can make the app vulnerable to what’s known as an <strong>XSS Attack (Cross-Site Scripting)</strong>.</p> <p>It is a type of code injection where malicious code is injected into a website using another web application.</p> <h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-using-sessions">Pros and Cons of using Sessions</h2> <h3 id="more-controlflexibility">More Control/Flexibility</h3> <p>Sessions give the developer more control over the app. If there is a breach, then you can immediately delete the session from the store, whereas blacklisting JWTs is tricky, and in the worst-case scenario, you would just have to wait for the token to expire.</p> <h3 id="easy-to-implement">Easy to Implement</h3> <p>Since session IDs are stored in cookies, there is no need to provide any request headers. This is because cookies are supported automatically by browsers and all cookies are sent as part of the request to all websites.</p> <p>It also reduces bandwidth usage when compared to JWT, since there is no need to send the token back and forth for every request made by the client. Cookies can also introduce a vulnerability for <strong>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks</strong>.</p> <p>This happens when requests through a malicious site force authenticated users on other websites to submit a request to the malicious website and get access to their credentials. This can be prevented by setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SameSite</code></a> cookie option to <strong>lax</strong>.</p> <p>SameSite decides if the cookie should be sent only to the origin website.</p> <h3 id="security">Security</h3> <p>Session stores are not public and are stored remotely on a server, hence rendering the session data to be safe. In the case of JWTs, the tokens are relayed on every request and can be intercepted. Sessions are, in most cases, safer than using JWTs</p> <h3 id="scalability-issues">Scalability Issues</h3> <p>Sessions can be a pain to scale because there is a requirement for a place to host the session store. You will need to store more data on the store when more users authenticate and this will take a load on the server which can be expensive depending on what hosting solution you go with.</p> <h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-using-jwts">Pros and Cons of using JWTs</h2> <h3 id="scalable">Scalable</h3> <p>Since JWTs store nothing on the server, it is stateless and scalable. As the user base grows, JWTs can scale since there is no overhead of requiring a store on the server.</p> <h3 id="you-can-not-worry-about-a-lot-of-stuff">You can “not-worry” about a lot of stuff</h3> <ul> <li><strong>CORS</strong>: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</li> <li>Domain Migration</li> <li>Portability: With sessions, you need a cookie store that only browsers have. You can use tokens while making clients for other devices too. But then you would have to resort to a different place to store the token on the client.</li> </ul> <h3 id="you-cant-truly-log-a-user-out">You can’t truly log a user out</h3> <p>You’d normally log a user out by removing the cookie with the access token in it. But this doesn’t ensure the <strong>validity of the access token</strong>. If an attacker gets hold of the token, he/she can still make requests to the server and do bad stuff.</p> <p>To prevent such things, you have to implement a blacklist system, where if you get a report of a stolen token, you add that token to a blacklist, and any request with a blacklisted token will be blocked.</p> <p>Simply removing the token from the hands of the client doesn’t solve the problem. You could introduce a refresh token, but then again that’s another token to deal with ;)</p> <h3 id="they-are-heavy">They are heavy</h3> <p>If you store a lot of junk on your token, you may exceed the size limit for a cookie. And I already told you why storing them on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localStorage</code> is probably a bad idea.. (CSRF <em>wink, wink</em>)</p> <h3 id="security-1">Security</h3> <p>JWTs are simply put, <em>not</em> secure. They can easily be intercepted and decrypted (Literally all you have to do is paste the token into a site like <a href="https://jwt.io">this</a> and you can get the user data inside it). This is exactly why you should never store any sensitive data in a token.</p> <p>Just store the required credentials that will allow the server to know who the user is.

It is a useful data structure to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Complex usage of arrays includes storing data in 2D, 3D, or other multidimensional arrays. This allows us to represent things like matrices, grids, and cubes effectively.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we will specifically focus on declaring, initializing and using 2D, 3D, and other multidimensional arrays in the Kotlin programming language.</p> <h2 id="1d-arrays-in-kotlin">1D Arrays in Kotlin</h2> <h3 id="1d-arrays-with-pre-defined-data">1D Arrays with pre-defined data</h3> <p>Simple 1D arrays in kotlin are declared using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arrayOf()</code> standard library function. It takes a list of values as an argument and returns a 1D array.</p> <p>Here’s an example:</p> <div class="language-kotlin highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">val</span> <span class="py">array</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nf">arrayOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This creates an array of Integer values with 5 elements: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code>.</p> <p>Type declaration is optional for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arrayOf()</code> and this makes the array flexible. If array type isn’t defined then you can store any kind of elements in the array. For example, you can use:</p> <div class="language-kotlin highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">val</span> <span class="py">array</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nf">arrayOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"two"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">3.0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>and it would work perfectly fine. You can verify this by iterating over the array and printing the values:</p> <div class="language-kotlin highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"$i is of type ${i::class.simpleName}"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="cm">/*
Output:

1 is of type Int
two is of type String
3.0 is of type Double
true is of type Boolean
*/</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But this defeats the purpose of type-safety in Kotlin. We would not want to store a string in an array of integers. To guarantee type-safety, we declare the type of the array during initialization so that the elements of the array are ensured to be of the same type. Otherwise, they would throw an error.</p> <p>To declare a type-safe 1D array in kotlin, we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arrayOf&lt;T&gt;()</code> function where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> is the type of the elements in the array.</p> <p>For example, to declare a type-safe 1D array of integers, we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arrayOf&lt;Int&gt;()</code>:</p> <div class="language-kotlin highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">val</span> <span class="py">array</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">arrayOf</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Int</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>If you try to add a string to the type-safe Int array, you will get an error:</p> <div class="language-kotlin highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">val</span> <span class="py">array</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">arrayOf</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Int</span><span class="p">&gt;(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"40"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="cm">/*
Doesn't even compile, error:

Type mismatch: inferred type is String but Int was expected
*/</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>It is pretty useful if you want to store data that is strongly typed.</p> <blockquote> <h3 id="fun-fact">Fun Fact</h3> <p>Kotlin standard library supports for functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">intArrayOf()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doubleArrayOf()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">booleanArrayOf()</code>, etc. to declare strongly typed arrays.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="1d-arrays-with-dynamic-size">1D arrays with dynamic size</h3> <p>For lists of dynamic size, we use the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mutableListOf()</code>. It works similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arrayOf()</code>, but provides us functions to perform actions on the list. Using them, we can add, remove, or modify the elements in the list without re-creating it!</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Unlike <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arrayOf()</code>, once <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mutableListOf()</code> automatically infers a single data type, you can’t change the data type of the list. To explicitly allow for it, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mutableListOf&lt;Any&gt;()</code> to add mixed data types to the list. If you pass in multiple data types in the constructor, the list will automatically be of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Any</code>.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mutableListOf&lt;T&gt;()</code> allows us to manually define type-safe lists.</p> <p>Here are examples to declare a type-safe mutable lists with various examples:</p> <div class="language-kotlin highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">val</span> <span class="py">list2</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="nf">mutableListOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// Type is inferred as Int, similar to mutableListOf&lt;Int&gt;()</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Here, we make the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ItemDatabase</code> abstract because Room will auto-generate it for us. Inside the class’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">companion object</code> block, we define a function that returns the instance of the database.</p> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getInstance()</code> function is interesting! We put up this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSTANCE</code> returning logic to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition">race conditions</a>. Basically, if two pieces of code try to access the same resource at the same time, it causes race conditions. For generalized objects it is okay, but for something like Databases- we never want to cause conflicts between data.</p> <p>That’s the reason we either return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSTANCE</code> of the Room Database if it is not null (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?:</code> elvis operator), or if it is we then add the logic to build the database, assign it to the instance and then return it.</p> <p>We add a callback of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RoomDatabase.Callback()</code> to execute some code once the database is created. We use this to pre-populate the database with some fake preloaded data.</p> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(0..100).forEach()</code> loop goes over the range and adds <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Item</code> objects to the database, with the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Item &lt;number&gt;</code> for each iteration. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> passed is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> because this will be autogenerated by Room anyways.</p> <h1 id="2-setup-recyclerview">2.

This is the place where we define our pagination configuration.</p> <p>We define that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pageSize</code> should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20</code>. This means that the Paging 3 library will load <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20</code> values at a time from the data. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initialLoadSize</code> is also set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20</code> because if unset, the paging library loads <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3 * pageSize</code> for the first load.</p> <p>We pass a lambda that defines a lambda and pass in our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MainPagingSource</code> class.

I guess I took a long break from blogging but I am back with some interesting web3 stuff. Today we are doing to be BUIDLing a command-line interface that would act as a faucet and we would be also adding metamask authentication to it 🚀!</p> <p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/oR5fQW3UW78AAAAC/gm-web3.gif" alt="https://c.tenor.com/oR5fQW3UW78AAAAC/gm-web3.gif"/></p> <h1 id="-the-idea">💡 The idea</h1> <p>Let’s understand the idea of the command-line interface which we are going to be building. It’s a simple command-line interface that would transfer testnet tokens to the user and we are going to be adding metamask authentication also 👀.</p> <p>Wait what? Metamask authentication via a CLI ???</p> <p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/awhlFQC8WcAAAAAM/kid-what.gif" alt="https://c.tenor.com/awhlFQC8WcAAAAAM/kid-what.gif"/></p> <p>Let me explain how are we going to implement the Metamask authentication.</p> <ul> <li>We would create a basic website using Next.js which would have the connect with wallet (Metamask authentication) button. We would be using thirdweb to add Metamask authentication to our Next.js website.</li> <li>After the user has authenticated themselves via Metamask on the website, they would be redirected to a page with route <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/callback</code>. When redirected the page would also contain a query parameter that contains the user’s wallet address 👀. So the user would be redirected to a page with route path something like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/callback?address=0xd24CA0297558f0827e2C467603869D1AC9fF435d</code>.</li> <li>We would be starting up a local express application at port <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">9991</code> (don’t worry we would be immediately closing the port after the authentication process is been completed). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/callback</code> route exists on this local express application.</li> <li>👀 We don’t want the user to be seeing a blank page for hours right? (in context to make the user stay on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/callback</code> route on the local express application) Instead, we can redirect them to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/done</code> route on the main website, so that they will know that the authentication process is being completed.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://imgur.com/OeXrCG0.png" alt="Authentication workflow"/></p> <p>😵‍💫 Woah! That’s hard to digest in one go</p> <h1 id="️-tech-stack">⚒️ Tech stack</h1> <p>The tech stack which we are going to be using to build this CLI:</p> <ul> <li>TypeScript as the main programming language that we are going to be using to program the command-line interface, website, and the backend</li> <li>Next.js as the framework that we are going to be using to build the website</li> <li>Tailwind CSS as our CSS framework to style the website</li> <li>Express as the backend framework</li> <li>Oclif as our command-line interface framework</li> <li>Thirdweb for the metamask authentication</li> <li>Web3.js and Ethers to perform tasks such as sending the testnet token to the user</li> <li>Alchemy as our blockchain node service</li> </ul> <h1 id="️-building-the-website">🛠️ Building the website</h1> <h2 id="️-creating-a-new-nextjs-project">🏗️ Creating a new Next.js project</h2> <p>Let’s create a new Next.js project by using the following command:</p> <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npx create-next-app <span class="nt">-e</span><span class="o">=</span>with-tailwindcss thw-faucet-cli

The path of the config file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.json</code>) would be something like this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;user's-root-dir&gt;/.thw-faucet-cli/config.json</code>.

Make sure that you are present in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server</code> directory, if not then run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd server</code> command before running the above commands.</p> <p><img src="https://imgur.com/nu1v6ji.png" alt=""/></p> <p>👀 We have just created a basic express application. Let’s now understand how can we test the routes which we have added. Currently, we only have one route but as our backend grows, we would have more and more routes.</p> <p>If you are using VSCode then there is a pretty good extension that can help you to test the API routes inside VSCode itself. Go ahead and search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thunder Client</code> in the extensions tab and install the one whose author is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ranga Vadhineni</code>.</p> <p>After you have installed Thunder Client, you would see a thunder icon in the left sidebar.</p> <p><img src="https://imgur.com/IWAyZnh.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Click that thunder client and you would see a webview something like this:</p> <p><img src="https://imgur.com/56PS9C2.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Click the “New Request” button and you would see a screen like this:</p> <p><img src="https://imgur.com/2qtTgLk.png" alt=""/></p> <p>If you have used Postman before then you would feel this interface is familiar.</p> <p>Let’s change the URL to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:3000/</code> and click the “Send” button.</p> <p><img src="https://imgur.com/9EyPFvl.png" alt=""/></p> <p>You would see the response like this:</p> <p><img src="https://imgur.com/rvKbvOo.png" alt=""/></p> <p>Let’s now start building the actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request</code> route which would send the tokens to the user.</p> <p>Let’s create a new folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">controllers</code>, this folder would contain the core logic for the respective routes. Create a new file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request.ts</code> under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">controllers</code> folder.</p> <p>It’s the time to interact with the blockchain using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ethers</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">web3.js</code> libraries.</p> <p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/siUF6_Z22eUAAAAC/wow.gif" alt=""/></p> <p>Let’s add the following code to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/controllers/request.ts</code> file, don’t worry we would be explaining the code:</p> <div class="language-tsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">Request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Response</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">express</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>

Because the latest version of ora is a pure ESM module and instead of changing a hell lot of code, we can just install the version of ora which isn’t pure ESM.</p> <p>Ora comes with in-built TypeScript declarations so there is no need to install separately for its types.</p> </li> <li> <p>We are importing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">axios</code> package and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chalk</code> package. We have already installed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chalk</code> package previously. So to install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">axios</code> package run the following command:</p> <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>yarn add axios
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> <li> <p>You might notice we are importing a variable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apiUrl</code> from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">constants/constants.ts</code> file.

By getting the data from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">req.body</code>.</p> <p>You can test it from the <a href="https://www.thunderclient.com/">Thunder Client</a> extension in VS Code, <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> or <a href="https://insomnia.rest/download">Insomnia</a>.

That will be accessible to the page. You can read about <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getServerSideProps</code> on the Next.js docs</a></p> <blockquote> <p>IMPORTANT: Make sure to sanitize the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tests</code> variable with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(tests))</code> because it contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ObjectID</code> from MongoDB instead of a normal string. This trick converts it into a string that can be passed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> object.</p> </blockquote> <p>That’s it!

The article piqued my interest and I set out to learn how to contribute to open-source projects without possibly writing any code.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634907925426/tBnszIUMD.png" alt="get started with open source"/></p> <p>In this article, I will share with you what I discovered and also mention some non-code ways you can contribute, open-source projects you can contribute to, and helpful resources.</p> <h1 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h1> <ul> <li><a href="#what-are-open-source-projects">What are Open Source Projects?</a></li> <li><a href="#how-can-technical-writers-and-non-code-individuals-contribute-to-open-source-projects">How can technical writers and non-code individuals contribute to open source projects?</a></li> <li><a href="#benefits-of-contributing-to-open-source-projects">Benefits of contributing to open-source projects</a></li> <li><a href="#open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</a></li> <li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li> <li><a href="#helpful-resources">Helpful resources</a></li> </ul> <h1 id="what-are-open-source-projects">What are Open Source Projects?</h1> <p>Open Source is a term used to describe software whose original source code is freely available, can be redistributed, and also modified.

You can also create translated documentation for the project.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>How about design?</strong> As a designer, you can contribute to open source projects by restructuring the project’s usability. You can also create a logo and style guide.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Have a knack for organizing perhaps?</strong> You can suggest issues labels and close open issues to keep the repository clean.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Do you enjoy assisting others?</strong> Moderate discussion boards and respond to questions on forums like Microsoft Tech Community, Reddit, and Stack Overflow.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Teaching?</strong> Write how-to and educational tutorials, as well as supporting materials.

I faced the same issue for <a href="/">Genics Blog</a>. I’ve built the blog from scratch using Jekyll.</p> <p>The primary feature of this publication is having the support for multiple authors. I have tackled this problem in two ways which I’ll be discussing in this post!</p> <h1 id="1-traditional-approach-using-data-files">1. Traditional approach using data files</h1> <p>The traditional approach is very straight forward but comes with its own limitations.</p> <p>We start by defining a file inside the <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data/</code></strong> folder that hosts author’s information.</p> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data/authors.yml</code></strong></p> <div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">johndoe</span><span class="pi">:</span>

    <span class="na">twitter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">jane_doe"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now we have the author objects in this file. Then we generate a layout that has the blueprint for the author’s page. A minimal layout looks like this:</p> <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">"en"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

{% assign author = site.data.authors[page.author] %}
<span class="c">&lt;!--
  Now you can use the author variable.
  It has all the data as defined inside _data/authors.yml for the current author.
--&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- See how we can use values inside the author variable. --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"description"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">{{</span> <span class="na">author.bio</span> <span class="err">}}</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- other stuff --&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>{{ author.name }}<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>{{ author.bio }}<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

    {% assign links = author.socials %}
    <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"{{ link.twitter }}"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Twitter<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"{{ link.github }}"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>GitHub<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>

    <span class="c">&lt;!--
      Here we get all the posts by the author of the current page.
      And then render a post preview box for each of the post.
    --&gt;</span>
    {% assign posts = site.posts | where_exp:"item", "item.author == page.author" %}
    {% for post in posts %}
      {% include postbox.html %}
    {% endfor %}
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Here, we get the author data for the current page and assign relevant meta information on the page. The information comes from the data files we set.</p> <p>Then we get all the posts by the author of the current page using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where_exp</code> filter (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/">docs for filters</a>). Then we render a post preview box for each of the post.</p> <p>The postbox can be any way you want to present the post. This is similar to what an index page would have as as to keep the structure uniform.</p> <p>Now, we assign an author to each post in the site by adding this to the post’s front matter:</p> <div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="c1"># other config</span>
<span class="na">author</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">johndoe</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We need to keep the same author username as defined in the data file.</p> <p>This sets up the configuration for the author’s page. But the pages won’t be rendered because Jekyll doesn’t know where to render the pages.</p> <p>Now, we create a collection for the author pages so that we can output author pages at the desired location.</p> <p>To create the collection, add this to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file:</p> <div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">collections</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">authors</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">output</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
    <span class="na">permalink</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/author/:author/</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This let’s us have a folder named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_authors/</code> in the root directoy and have the markdown files for authors there. <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/">More on collections &gt;</a></p> <p>Inside the folder, we add individual files named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">johndoe.md</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">janedoe.md</code>. This renders these files at endpoints <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/author/johndoe</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/author/janedoe</code> respectively.</p> <p>Make sure to add these lines in the files (variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">author</code> changes as per file):</p> <div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">author</span>
<span class="na">author</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">johndoe</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That’s it!</p> <p>This is the general way that allows us to add multiple authors to a simple Jekyll blog. Nothing fancy here. It was a bit long to setup but adding new authors is as easy as creating a new file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_authors</code> folder, defining data in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data/authors.yml</code> and adding the author’s name to the post’s front matter.</p> <p>But you see, this process is way tedious!</p> <p>You have to add the file for each author. Sure, it scales well upto about 10-15 authors. But for a publication like <a href="/">Genics Blog</a> that is consistently gaining traction for new authors, this becomes a pain.</p> <p>I had set up an automated process using GitHub Actions that would add the markdown file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_authors</code> folder as soon as a PR for a new author profile is received. But that doesn’t scale well and isn’t the most optimum way to do it!</p> <p>So I spent some time building up a solution for this. Let’s look at how it works!</p> <h1 id="2-using-my-plugin-jekyll-auto-authors">2. Using my plugin jekyll-auto-authors</h1> <p>There’s a major issue of pagination with the above approach. For example, let’s take <a href="/author/gouravkhunger/">my profile</a> at Genics Blog. I’ve got tons of posts. Along with Each post has a thumbnail image associated with it.</p> <p>The above method doesn’t have pagination support. Now if all the posts are listed in a single page, the page speed becomes too low.</p> <p>I’ve already setup <a href="https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-paginate-v2</code></a> for paginating category and tag pages. But it doesn’t work with authors. Also, it has got an amazing autopages feature for auto-generating category and tag pages that I use extensively for Genics.</p> <p>I wished to integrate autopages for authors functionality to it, but the paginate-v2 plugin isn’t being actively maintained. So I decided to build <a href="https://github.com/gouravkhunger/jekyll-auto-authors" rel="dofollow"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-auto-authors</code></a> that works in sync with it. Drop a star at GitHub to show support!</p> <p>Let’s look at how to start using the plugin. If you prefer a video tutorial, watch this:</p> <div class="mb-6 aspect-video"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5Ly6T_bWwU" class="w-full h-full rounded-xl" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"> </iframe> </div> <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2> <p>Add the plugin to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll_plugins</code> group:</p> <div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:jekyll_plugins</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="c1"># other gems</span>

    <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"jekyll-auto-authors"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now, execute:</p> <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle <span class="nb">install</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2> <p>This plugin fits well inside the configuration for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-paginate-v2</code> plugin.</p> <p>First, you need to set pagination configuration inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file. This is similar to what the pagination plugin does.</p> <div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">pagination</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">enabled</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
  <span class="na">per_page</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">9</span>
  <span class="na">permalink</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">/page/:num/'</span>
  <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">:title</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">-</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">page</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">:num'</span>
  <span class="na">sort_field</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">date'</span>
  <span class="na">sort_reverse</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This configuration will be used for the pagination on the generated author pages. The above example defines that each page should get 9 posts at max. The permalink of first page is same, but the later pages get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/page/:num</code> appended to it. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:num</code> gets converted to the page number.</p> <p>You can skip the pagination by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enabled: false</code>, if you only care about auto-generation of author pages.</p> <p>Now we’ll define the autopages config for authors.</p> <p>Define an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autopages</code> block to set up author autopages:</p> <div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">autopages</span><span class="pi">:</span>

  <span class="c1"># Other autopage configs for jekyll-paginate-v2 stay the same</span>

  <span class="na">authors</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">enabled</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span> <span class="c1"># adding false here stops the auto-generation</span>

      <span class="na">cased</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span> <span class="c1"># if true, the uppercase letters in slug will be converted to lowercase ones.</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That’s it for the autopages and pagination configuration.</p> <p>As an example, we will use the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data/authors.yml</code> file as generated in the previous step.</p> <p>All the data for an author is passed on to the liquid template inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page.pagination.author_data</code> variable so that you can render it as you wish!</p> <p>Let’s define a basic template for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">author.html</code> layout so you get a gist of how to use it:</p> <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">"en"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

{% assign author = page.pagination.author_data %}
<span class="c">&lt;!--
  Now you can use the author variable anyhow.
  It has all the data as defined inside _data/authors.yml for the current author.
--&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- See how we can use values inside the author variable. --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"description"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">{{</span> <span class="na">author.bio</span> <span class="err">}}</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- other stuff --&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>

      The main logic for rendering an author's posts resides here.
      The plugin exposes a paginator object that you can use to loop through the post.
      It handles all the pagination logic for you.
    --&gt;</span>
    {% for post in paginator.posts %}
      {% include postbox.html %}
    {% endfor %}

    <span class="c">&lt;!--
      If you don't want pagination, you can use the old way!
    --&gt;</span>
    {% assign posts = site.posts | where_exp:"item", "item.author.name == author.name" %}
    {% for post in posts %}
      {% include postbox.html %}
    {% endfor %}
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
