Hello there, I hope you are doing well!

This is the first article in the [Genics log](/category/genics-log) series where we will be documenting our monthly progress on the blog and report what's been brewing up in the past months.

Before diving into the latest news at Genics, I would like to introduce myself. I am [Gourav Khunger](/author/gouravkhunger/), the founder of [Genics Blog](/). I am a teenager from India who is passionate about software development and [open source](/tag/open-source/).

Let's get started!

# Introduction

Genics Blog went [open-source](https://github.com/genicsblog) at this New Year, which means we started accepting community contributions for the blog.

Within a month itself, we have reached huge milestones! Here's a gist of some stats from the past month:

- The **Core team** members increased from **1 to 5 members**!
- A total of **15 articles** were posted in January!
- A total of **40 members** joined the [Genics Blog discord server](https://discord.genicsblog.com)!
- Rose from **200 monthly visitors to 500+**!

# How it all started

I always wanted to create a community of skilled developers who create quality content around topics!

As the new year began, I grabbed the opportunity to open source my [existing blog](https://blog.gouravkhunger.xyz) and build a community around the existing content.

And since we chose the open source way, we quickly rose from 200 visitors/month to 500+ visitors/month!

# Open Source Setup

We use [GitHub](https://github.com) for our open source projects. Everything we build around Genics is open source because we want to be as transparent as we can!

For this blog, we used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate the website and render all the content. The beauty of Jekyll is we can use any design template, while writing the articles in markdown format. It renders the complete site with an easy build command!

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) works really well for hosting the website, because jekyll generates static html pages which work seamlessly with GitHub Pages.

There's a lot more to share on how the site and management works. I'd love to write articles on how we build and operate our systems completely for **FREE**, so keep an eye out on the [developer documentation](https://docs.genicsblog.com/developer) and future posts on Genics blog!

# Announcing BeyondWords.io Sponsorship

Just a few days ago we got sponsored by [BeyondWords.io](https://beyondwords.io/?utm_source=genicsblog.com&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=advertisement){:rel="dofollow"}!

> BeyondWords is an AI voice and audio publishing platform that brings frictionless audio to writers, newsrooms, and businesses!

It is a platform that allows anyone to publish their written scripts in audio format to the world. In my opinion, the best part about is its text to speech AI conversion modules are far better than those of Google and Amazon as the audio it generates seems to be near human voice!

[Genics Blog](/) got sponsored by [BeyondWords](https://beyondwords.io) where they generously offered us free services to convert our articles to audio formats! You can try out the audio functionality right at the top of this post!
