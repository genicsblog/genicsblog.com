Hey There! What's up!

![hello](https://media.giphy.com/media/zSHERzpaQ9x8k/giphy.gif)

So Web3 has been in total hype these days, and a lot of developers have been trying out web3 lately, including me. 

And, Authentication is one of the most skeptical parts of a Full Stack application! And in Web 3.0, this flow is managed by wallets, and Metamask is the most popular among them. 

So, in this article, I'm going to show how you can integrate Metamask auth with ThirdWeb in NextJS!

### Demo of what we are building today:

{% include loom.html id="d28cd1093e8046a8b9475777d3bf65ac" %}

### Installing a new NextJS app

First, create a NextJS app. I'm also using Tailwind CSS as my UI preference. You can use anything that you like.


```shell
npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss metamask-auth
``` 

#### Clear up the boilerplate

Now, clear up the boilerplate in the `index.js` file.


```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return <div></div>;
}
``` 

#### Installing the dependencies

Now, we will install the only required dependency for this app, `@3rdweb/hooks`. Go ahead and install `@3rdweb/hooks` in your project directory.


```shell
# for npm
npm i @3rdweb/hooks

# for yarn
yarn add @3rdweb/hooks
``` 

### Setting up the Third Web Provider

Now, we are going to set up the `ThirdwebWeb3Provider` in our `_app.js` file:


```jsx
import "../styles/globals.css";
import { ThirdwebWeb3Provider } from "@3rdweb/hooks";

import "regenerator-runtime/runtime";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const supportedChainIds = [80001, 4];

  const connectors = {
    injected: {},
  };

  return (
    <ThirdwebWeb3Provider
      supportedChainIds={supportedChainIds}
      connectors={connectors}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebWeb3Provider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
``` 

Here, first, we are going to import the provider and `regenerator-runtime/runtime` at the top of the script.


```jsx
import { ThirdwebWeb3Provider } from "@3rdweb/hooks";

import "regenerator-runtime/runtime";
``` 

Next, in the main function, we are specifying the `supportedChainIds` and `connectors`. You might be wondering what are these.

`supportedChainIds` contains a list of networks that are supported by our app. Here, `80001` is for `Mumbai Testnet Network` and `4` is for `Rinkeby Testnet Network`.

`connectors` is basically all the wallet providers we want to support. Here, `injected` is for Metamask wallet. This will be used when we are actually making the function to connect wallet.

Next, we are wrapping our whole app in `ThirdwebWeb3Provider` with `supportedChainIds` and `connectors` props to specify the configuration.

That's it for the `_app.js` file.

### Making a UI in the `index.js` file

Now, let's first make a UI for the login flow.

Head over to `index.js` file and make a simple `button` to connect wallet.


```jsx
export default function Home() {

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen py-2 bg-slate-100">
        <button
          className="px-4 py-2 rounded-md bg-purple-600 cursor-pointer hover:bg-purple-500 text-xl font-semibold duration-100 text-white"
        >
          Connect Wallet
        </button>
    </div>
  );
}
``` 

At this point, you will have a basic UI like this:

### Building the connect wallet functionality

Now, let's build the `connect wallet` functionality.

First, we will import the `useWeb3` hook from `@3rdweb/hooks` in our `index.js` file:


```jsx
import { useWeb3 } from "@3rdweb/hooks" 
``` 

Now, inside the `Home` component:


```jsx
const { connectWallet, address, error } = useWeb3();
``` 

Now, we are going to assign the `connectWallet` to the connect wallet button:


```jsx
<button className="px-4 py-2 rounded-md bg-purple-600 cursor-pointer hover:bg-purple-500 text-xl font-semibold duration-100 text-white"
onClick={()=>connectWallet("injected")}
>
      Connect Wallet
</button>
``` 

Here, we are passing `injected` as a param to the `connectWallet` function. If you remember from the above steps, this is used to specify that we are going to use Metamask to authenticate user.

Now, at this point, you will have a working connect wallet button.

#### Displaying user address:

Now, in the `Home` component, we are going to check if the user is authenticated and then render component based on that:


```jsx

return (
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen py-2 bg-slate-100">
    {address ? (
      <p className="px-2 py-1 rounded-full bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300 font-mono font-medium cursor-pointer duration-100">
        {address}
      </p>
    ) : (
      <button
        className="px-4 py-2 rounded-md bg-purple-600 cursor-pointer hover:bg-purple-500 text-xl font-semibold duration-100 text-white"
        onClick={()=>connectWallet("injected")}
      >
        Connect Wallet
      </button>
    )}
  </div>
);
``` 

#### Error handling: 

Sometimes, the app may not work cause of errors, so in that case, we can use the `error` object and log its value.

Below our `useWeb3` hook:

```jsx
const { connectWallet, address, error } = useWeb3();

error ? console.log(error) : null;
``` 

That's it! We have done it!
