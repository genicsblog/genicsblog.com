Yes, dear reader, you read that right! You can build beautiful CLIs with React using an awesome library called [React Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink)!

The way this library works is best summed up by the README of the repo:

> Ink provides the same component-based UI building experience that React offers in the browser, but for command-line apps. It uses [Yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga) to build Flexbox layouts in the terminal, so most CSS-like props are available in Ink as well. If you are already familiar with React, you already know Ink. Since Ink is a React renderer, it means that all features of React are supported. Head over to [React](https://reactjs.org/) website for documentation on how to use it. Only Ink's methods will be documented in this readme.

# What we‚Äôll build üóìÔ∏è

In this post, we‚Äôll explore how Ink works by building a cool little CLI, that fetches info about pokemon using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)!

# Creating an Ink project ü™ú

This is extremely simple and straight-forward.

- First you will create an empty directory

```shell
mkdir pokecli && cd pokecli
```

- Then you can run the `create-ink-app` command

```shell
npx create-ink-app --typescript
```

In this post, I will use TypeScript, but you can follow along with plain JS too.

If we take a look at what this command has generated, we can see a very basic file structure:

```
pokecli
	source/
	.editorconfig
	.gitattributes
	package-lock.json
	package.json
	readme.md
	tsconfig.json
```

We can ignore everything other than the `source` folder.

`source/ui.tsx`

```tsx
import React, { FC } from "react";
import { Text } from "ink";
const App: FC<{ name?: string }> = ({ name = "Stranger" }) => (
  <Text>
    Hello, <Text color="green">{name}</Text>
  </Text>
);
module.exports = App;
export default App;
```

This is a normal App component like you would see in plain React. A prop `name` is passed on to this component which is set to a default value of Stranger. And a message of "Hello, {name}" is rendered. Note that the `Text` component comes from `ink`.

It can be used to style many aspects of the text, like the color, background color etc. `ink` uses a library called [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) to do this.

`source/cli.tsx`

```tsx
#!/usr/bin/env node
import React from "react";
import { render } from "ink";
import meow from "meow";
import App from "./ui";
const cli = meow(
  `
	Usage
	  $ pokecli
	Options
		--name  Your name
	Examples
	  $ pokecli --name=Jane
	  Hello, Jane
`,
  {
    flags: {
      name: {
        type: "string",
      },
    },
  }
);
render(<App name={cli.flags.name} />);
```

This file is the entry point of the CLI application. The `meow` function displays the text that will appear in the `--help` flag. And then it pulls the render function from `ink` to display the exported `App` component from `ui.tsx`. `name` is a command-line argument which can be set by the user like this:

```shell
pokecli --name=Charmander
```

We can see that this arg has an explicit type of `string`. Since, we now have a basic understanding of how Ink works, let‚Äôs get on to creating our CLI!

# Running the CLI üèÉ

We can run this code by first compiling our source code into an executable

```shell
npm run build
```

And then running the executable:

```shell
pokecli --name=Charmander
```

And we‚Äôll be able to see our output!

You can also run pokecli with the `--help` flag to see the output of what‚Äôs passed to the `meow` function in `cli.tsx`

# Building our CLI üõ†Ô∏è

Let‚Äôs first make a simple function to fetch the data of a pokemon through it‚Äôs name, in `ui.tsx`.

We will do this using a library called [axios](https://axios-http.com/).

```shell
npm i axios
```

We can then use this function to send a request to PokeAPI.

```tsx
// fetch pokemon data with its name using pokeapi
const pokemon = (name: string): void => {
  axios
    .get(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name.toLowerCase()}`)
    .then((res) => {
      console.log(res.data);
    });
};
```

And if you test this out, we‚Äôll be able to see the data associated with what is passed in the CLI name flag.

The problem with this is that, TypeScript doesn‚Äôt know the properties that exist in this data object. So let‚Äôs declare interfaces for the API response.

```tsx
interface Type {
  slot: number;
  type: {
    name: string;
  };
}
interface Stat {
  base_stat: number;
  effort: number;
  stat: {
    name: string;
  };
}
interface PokemonData {
  name: string;
  height: number;
  weight: number;
  types: Type[];
  stats: Stat[];
}
```

Let‚Äôs also create a state variable to store our pokemon data:

```tsx
const [pokemonData, setPokemonData] = React.useState<PokemonData | null>(null);
```

Now, we can update our function to fetch the pokemon data accordingly:

```tsx
// fetch pokemon data with its name using pokeapi
const pokemon = (name: string): Promise<PokemonData> => {
  const url = `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${name}`;
  return axios
    .get<PokemonData>(url)
    .then((response: AxiosResponse<PokemonData>) => {
      return response.data;
    });
};
```

Cool!

Now let‚Äôs call this function in a `useEffect` hook:

```tsx
// call useEffect and use store the pokemon data in state
useEffect(() => {
  pokemon(name).then((data: PokemonData) => {
    setPokemonData(data);
  });
}, [name]);
```

Awesome!

Now all we have to do, is just render the data. Since our state will be `null` if the pokemon data is not yet set, we can use that as a loading indicator.

```tsx
return (
  (pokemonData &&
    {
      /* pokemon stuff */
    }) || <Text>Loading...</Text>
);
```

And then we can display the pokemon data:

```tsx
return (
  (pokemonData && (
    <Box>
      <Text>
        <Text bold color="blue">
          {pokemonData?.name[0]?.toUpperCase() + pokemonData!.name?.slice(1)}
        </Text>
        {"\n"}
        {/* Display a divider */}
        <Text color="magentaBright">
          {Array(pokemonData?.name.length + 1).join("-")}
        </Text>
        {"\n"}
        <Text color="yellowBright">Metrics:</Text> <Text
          color="greenBright"
          bold
        >
          {/* Height is in decimeters */}
          {pokemonData!.height / 10}m, {pokemonData!.weight / 10}kg
        </Text>
        {"\n"}
        <Text color="yellowBright">Type:</Text> <Text color="greenBright" bold>
          {/* Display the pokemon's types */}
          {pokemonData?.types.map((type: Type) => type.type.name).join(", ")}
        </Text>
        {"\n\n"}
        {/* Display the pokemon's stats */}
        <Text color="yellowBright" bold>
          Stats{"\n"}
        </Text>
        <Text color="greenBright">{pokemonData?.stats.map((stat: Stat) => `${stat.stat.name}: ${stat.base_stat}`).join("\n")}</Text>
      </Text>
    </Box>
  )) || <Text>Loading...</Text>
);
```

Now you should be able to see this:

![https://i.imgur.com/gSHipFy.gif](https://i.imgur.com/gSHipFy.gif)

We can clear the terminal screen before the data is shown. There is an NPM library called [`clear`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clear) which we can use to achieve this.

```shell
npm i clear
```

Since it is written in JS, we‚Äôll need the type definitions for it too.

```shell
npm i -D @types/clear
```

Now, we can call the `clear` function above our JSX.

```tsx
	clear();
	return (
		(pokemonData && (
			<Box>
				<Text>
					<Text bold color="blue">
          ...
```

Cool!

You can also change the help text:

`cli.tsx`

```tsx
const cli = meow(
  `
	Usage
	  $ pokecli
	Options
		--name The name of the pokemon 
	Examples
	  $ pokecli --name=charmander
		Charmander
		----------
		Metrics: 0.6m, 8.5 kg
		Type: fire
		Stats
		hp: 39
		attack: 52
		defense: 43
		special-attack: 60
		special-defense: 50
		speed: 65
`,
  {
    flags: {
      name: {
        type: "string",
      },
    },
  }
);
```

Isn‚Äôt it cool how all the hooks and other React features work in a CLI? React sure is taking over the world üòâ

I‚Äôll see you in the next post! üëã
