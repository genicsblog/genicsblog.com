[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is an amazing tool to easily integrate user authentication in any kind of app you are building. It has a great set of tools to enable auth in your app in a few really quick steps.

Today, we are going to look into how to integrate Auth0 into your Android App! First, we'll set up the local project for integrating Auth0, and then we'll set up the app on the Auth0 dashboard.

Check out this video to learn what we are going to build in this tutorial:

{% include youtube.html id="obk3q1AaH6I" %}

The code for this basic app that we are going to build is present [here on GitHub](https://github.com/gouravkhunger/auth0-demo-android), star it and follow me :)

# Android app setup

## Initialize the project

First, create a new Android Studio Project.  If you are just checking out Auth0, you can follow the steps mentioned in [my previous article](https://genicsblog.com/how-to-create-your-first-android-app-using-android-studio) on how to make a basic project using Android Studio.

You can also use an existing project!

## Set up view binding

### What is it?

View binding is a new way of referencing views from XML layouts inside your java/kotlin classes. View Binding creates a Binding class for each XML layout resource which you can use to refer views without the hassle of using `findViewById()` or using the deprecated kotlin synthetics.

### Enable View Binding

If you are reading this post in the future, chances are that view binding is supported right into new projects using Android Studio.

If not, you can go into the App level `build.gradle` file and add this piece of code anywhere inside the `android` scope.

```groovy
buildFeatures {
    viewBinding true
}
```

This image will give you a gist of where to add it:

![Enable view binding in Android apps](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632594546418/IWp7Zd5Ju.png)

## Integrate Auth0

To integrate Auth0 into our project, we need to do the following things.

### Add Auth0 dependencies

In your app level `build.gradle` dependencies section, add the following:

```groovy
dependencies {
  // ... other dependencies

  // Auth0 Android SDK
  implementation 'com.auth0.android:auth0:2.4.0'
}
```

![Adding auth0 sdk to android app](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632596987895/ChRu2ueYY.png)

### Add manifest placeholders 

You need to add one more simple line of code to the app level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {

        // ...

        // Add this
        manifestPlaceholders = [auth0Domain: "@string/com_auth0_domain", auth0Scheme: "demo"]
    }
}
```

This creates an `intent-filter` which is used by the library to open your app back once the login is done by the user. If this is not done you have to define an `intent-filter` on your own. This method is easier than handling that.

*The `@string/com_auth0_domain` is actually a string resource, you need to declare it in your `strings.xml` as follows:*

```xml
<string name="com_auth0_domain">Your domain here</string>
```

![strings.xml file in android](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632597709645/Q0e7v73bC.png)

Don't worry if you don't have a domain like this yet, scroll below to find the auth0 dashboard setup, or you can skip this for now and come back to it later!

### Add Internet Permissions to Manifest

You would need to add the internet permission to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file to allow network access, else the app may crash during login process.

Add this line in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file as shown in the image below:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

![Adding internet permission in AndroidManifest.xml file](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632598305357/oBXJKdYTY.png)

## Make a basic UI

Open the `res/layout/activity_main.xml` file and replace the content with this layout:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:gravity="center"
    tools:context=".MainActivity">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/nameTv"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_margin="10dp"
        android:textSize="30sp"
        android:textColor="#000000"
        android:text="@string/john_doe" />

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/emailTv"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_marginBottom="28dp"
        android:textSize="18sp"
        android:text="@string/email" />

    <Button
        android:text="@string/login"
        android:id="@+id/loginBtn"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_marginTop="20dp"/>

    <Button
        android:text="@string/logout"
        android:id="@+id/logoutBtn"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_marginTop="10dp" />

</LinearLayout>
```

This will create a simple layout that has the name and email text on top and two buttons to log-in and log-out. You'll have to create string resources for dummy name and email placeholder.

## Coding the `MainActivity`

### Initialize View Binding

Create a `lateinit var` for the view binding:

```kotlin
private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding
```

Inflate the binding the the `onCreate()` method:

```kotlin
binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
```

Finally, set the root element of the binding as the content view:

```kotlin
setContentView(binding.root)
```

Here's what the `MainActivity.kt` file looks like after doing the above changes:

```kotlin
// package name
package com.github.gouravkhunger.auth0demo

// imports
import ...

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
    }
}
```

### Initialize Auth0

First, you'll need to create an instance of the Auth0 class.

```kotlin
// Imports
import ...

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    // other vars ...
    private lateinit var account: Auth0

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {

        // ...

        // Set up the account object with the Auth0 application details
        account = Auth0(
            "xljNBT32DCsVDN7sYDM1qEHMD2mA1fVp",
            "auth0-demo-android.us.auth0.com"
        )

        // ...
    }
}
```

*This is the client id and domain of my sample app, replace it with yours to make it work.* To get these parameters for your app, skip ahead to the setting up auth0 section.

### Add Log-in

Now, proceed to set the `onClickListener` on the button. This will be triggered whenever the button will be clicked.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        binding.loginBtn.setOnClickListener {
            WebAuthProvider.login(account)
                .withScheme("demo")
                .withScope("openid profile email")
                // Launch the authentication passing the callback where the results will be received
                .start(this, object : Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException> {
                    // Called when there is an authentication failure
                    override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
                        // Something went wrong!
                        Toast
                            .makeText(this@MainActivity, "Login Error: \n${error.message}", Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
                            .show()
                    }

                    // Called when authentication completed successfully
                    override fun onSuccess(result: Credentials) {
                        // Get the access token from the credentials object.
                        // This can be used to call APIs
                        val accessToken = result.accessToken
                        showUserProfile(accessToken)
                    }
                })
        }
    }
}
```

Now, once a user presses this button, the login process will start and they'll be asked to log in with their E-mail id. 

You can use any scheme name, here I used `demo`. I recommend not to use `https` because it might conflict with the intent-filters internally. I got this error while building [JekyllEx](https://genicsblog.com/introducing-jekyllex-android-app).

Once the login is successful, we can get the access token which can be used to retrieve the user profile. Let's make a function to get the user profile from the token:

```kotlin
private fun showUserProfile(accessToken: String) {
    val client = AuthenticationAPIClient(account)

    // With the access token, call `userInfo` and get the profile from Auth0.
    client.userInfo(accessToken)
        .start(object : Callback<UserProfile, AuthenticationException> {
            override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
                // Something went wrong!
                Toast.makeText(
                    this@MainActivity,
                    "Error getting profile \n${error.message}",
                    Toast.LENGTH_LONG
                ).show()
            }

            override fun onSuccess(result: UserProfile) {
                // We have the user's profile!
                binding.nameTv.text = result.name
                binding.emailTv.text = result.email
                Toast.makeText(
                    this@MainActivity,
                    "Login Successful!",
                    Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
                ).show()
            }
        })
}
```

### Add Log-out

Now, let's make a function that enables logging out.

```kotlin
private fun logout() {
    WebAuthProvider.logout(account)
        .withScheme("demo")
        .start(
            this,
            object : Callback<Void?, AuthenticationException> {
                override fun onSuccess(result: Void?) {
                    // The user has been logged out!
                    Toast.makeText(
                        this@MainActivity,
                        "Successfully logged out!",
                        Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
                    ).show()
                    binding.nameTv.text = resources.getString(R.string.john_doe)
                    binding.emailTv.text = resources.getString(R.string.email)
                }

                override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
                    Toast.makeText(
                        this@MainActivity,
                        "Couldn't Logout!",
                        Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
                    ).show()
                }
            }
        )
}
```

Now, our app is ready to handle log-in and logout. You can also [checkout the content](https://github.com/gouravkhunger/auth0-demo-android/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/github/gouravkhunger/auth0demo/MainActivity.kt) of the `MainActivity.kt` file on the repo.

# Setting up Auth0

## Make an account

First, let's do the setup needed at the auth0 dashboard. 

Go to the official [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) site and press signup on the navigation bar. After making an account, you would be taken to the dashboard where you can create a tenant. Here, the tenant is what auth0 calls a project. A project can have a number of applications in it.

*All the applications in a single-tenant have the same user database and storage.*

## Set up the tenant

Create a new tenant. You can choose any domain name for your tenant, here I am choosing `auth0-demo-android`. For now, this will be a subdomain, but you can customise it to your custom domain by upgrading your free plan.

![Creating a new tenant in Auth0 dashboard](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632595285718/pzRUUPZSOX.png)

## Create a new app

Go to the applications section and press create a new app. Since we are building an Android app, choose the native field and hit create.

![Creating a new app in auth0 dashboard](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632595589796/u_K9yatlS.png)

Since we are going to develop an app that will use this tenant, tag it in the `development` phase.

After creating your app, go to the app settings

![Settings tab of an app in Auth0](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632648478901/D6LpFj98V.png)

Scroll down to the Application URIs section. There add callback URLs for login and logout. These are required to let Auth0 know what apps are authorised to perform these actions as these strings contain identifiers for our app.

```
demo://<tenant-domain>.us.auth0.com/android/PACKAGE_NAME/callback
```

*Replace the package name and tenant domain with that of your own app. If you have set a scheme other than `demo`, change it here.*

Here's an example:

![Auth0 allowed callbacks urls](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632648617407/DJhXTcFJH.png)

![Auth0 allowed login urls](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632648626448/y2zKRWq53.png)

After adding them, scroll all the way to the bottom and save the changes.

Now you can go ahead and replace the Client IDs and such things in the code, wherever necessary.

# Congratulations 🥳 

You have successfully added Auth0 to your Android app. Trust me, though this post was long, it is actually really easy if you try it on your own.

If you stayed along till this far, I am really thankful to you! Please comment on your experience with Auth0 and this article.
